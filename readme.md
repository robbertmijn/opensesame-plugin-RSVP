=======
This plugin allows you to add a Rapid Serial Visual Presentation element to your experiment.
The plugin can be used, for example, in a concealed information test (CIT). The RSVP plugin
allows for pupil size measurements during a CIT. Previous research has shown that pupil size 
cannot be actively manipulated, while CITs that measure other bodily sensations can be 
manipulated (Chen et al., 2021). 

The project included research into the implementation of pupil size measurements in CIT and
the development of open source tools (presenting stimuli (text/images) on the screen, 
preparation of the stimuli, and analysis of the data) to be used in CIT. The project is 
funded by Police & Science (Politie & Wetenschap). 

## Features
The RSVP plugin provides an easy tool that can be implemented in an experiment. It contains
the following features:
* An automated rapid serial visual Presentation
* Compatible with both text and image stimuli
* Contains an inter stimulus interval
* Targets and distractors can shuffle
* Number of targets and distractors can be adjusted
